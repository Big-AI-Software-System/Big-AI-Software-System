To facilitate efficient context switches, GPUs usually employ a large-capacity register file to accommodate a massive amount of context information. 
However, the large register file introduces high power consumption, owing to high leakage power SRAM cells. 
Emerging non-volatile STT-RAM memory has recently been studied as a potential replacement to alleviate the leakage challenge when constructing register files on GPUs. 
Unfortunately, due to the long write latency and high energy consumption associated with write operations in STT-RAM, 
simply replacing SRAM with STTRAM for register files would incur non-trivial performance overhead and only bring marginal energy benefits. 

In this paper, we propose to optimize STT-RAM based GPU register files for better energy-efficiency and performance via two techniques. 
First, we employ a light-weight compression framework with awareness of register value similarity. 
It is coupled with a group-based write driver control to mitigate the high energy overhead caused bySTT-RAMwrites. 
Second,toaddressthelongwrite latency overhead of STT-RAM, we propose a centralized SRAMbased write buffer design to efficiently absorb STT-RAM writes with better buffer utilization, 
rather than the conventional design with distributed per-bank based write buffers. 
The experimental results show that our STT-RAM based register file design consumes only 37.4% energy over the SRAM baseline, while incurring only negligible performance degradation.
